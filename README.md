  ## Description ‚ú®
  This week's project was to build the backend of an eCommerce site using Express.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, and dotenv. In order to build the backend of this site, I used the packages listed and followed Module 13 lessons closely to find patterns and replicate them in my work. I was able to complete this project in 1 day thanks to starter code that was provided to me through my Coding Bootcamp. You can find a link to the walkthrough video on my [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjdVerSWTuU) üíô

  ## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è
  Clone down this repo, run a 'npm init -y', then 'npm i' to install the dependencies. When that's done, enter the MySQL shell using 'mysql -u root -p' and enter your password. Then you'll run 'source db/schema.sql;' and exit the shell and then run 'npm run seed' to seed your db. Finally, run 'npm start' and test the routes in an app like Insomnia!

  ## Usage
  This app provides the backend of an eCommerce site and holds data for products, categories, tags, etc.
